## Experiments on the IXI dataset (T1 images) for brain age estimation

This is the code for running the experiments for the brain age estimation from MRI scans task. 

### Data

The dataset can be downloaded from: https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/


## Running

Run scripts for CPS, UCVME, and CLSS are provided in script_cps.sh, scripts_ucvme.sh and scripts_clss.sh respectively. Runs using multiple seeds are recommended as convergence is more difficult for this task. 


## Pretrained models

A sample checkpoint using 50% labeled data is provided:
